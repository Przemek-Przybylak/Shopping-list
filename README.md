## Welcome
I'm glad you decided to watch my new site.  
If you need to do shopping, you've come to the right place!  

## Shopping-list what it is?
As the name suggests, the program is used to create a shopping list.  
The program itself renders the view after each change, so that the entire list can be dynamically handled.  
You can add, delete, and mark products as purchased.

## Breakdown of Shopping-list.
Project is divided into 3 main parts:

1. Index.html - this file contains the document structure and its content.
2. css - this folder is the space for page styles. These styles make up the hompage layout.
3. js - this folder is the space for javascript. the javascript is responsible for the functionality of the website.

## Technology used in the Shopping-list  
BEM - The Block, Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS. Introduction: (http://getbem.com/introduction/)  
HTML5 - the structure of the document is rendered using html in Living standard. Introduction: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)  
ES6+ Features - In javascript I use features introduced in ECMAScript 6, or newer ones. Introduction: (https://benmccormick.org/2015/09/14/es5-es6-es2016-es-next-whats-going-on-with-javascript-versioning)  
CSS -  
- alternative box model.  
- flex box.  
- normalize.  

## How it's works?  
After switching on, add the products you want to buy in the field at the top side. ( Co jest do zrobienia? )  
When you add a product, the page will automatically refresh and a list will be rendered below, which will contain the product. ( below inscription: "Lista zada≈Ñ" )  
The added product can be marked as bought by pressing the green button on the left side.  
If a given task is no longer needed, you can delete it by clicking the red button on its right side ( the icon shows a trash can ).  
Don't worry, if you don't understand something, below you will find a gif that shows all the functions.
